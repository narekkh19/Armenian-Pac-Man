Features
Classic Pac-Man Gameplay: Navigate the maze, eat all the pellets, and avoid the ghosts!
Unique Armenian Theme:
The maze walls are built from Tuf (’ø’∏÷Ç÷Ü), a famous Armenian volcanic rock.
Pac-Man collects Dram (÷è), the currency of Armenia, instead of standard pellets.
Four Unique Ghosts: Each ghost has its own canonical targeting AI implemented:
üî¥ Blinky: The chaser, who directly targets Pac-Man.
üå∏ Pinky: The ambusher, who targets a space in front of Pac-Man.
üíß Inky: The flanker, whose target is based on the positions of both Pac-Man and Blinky.
üçä Clyde: The unpredictable one, who chases Pac-Man when far away but retreats to his corner when close.
Animated Sprites: Smooth, animated sprites for Pac-Man and all ghosts, with directional graphics.
UI Manager: Clean game over and win screens with animated text that grows to fill the window.
Score Tracking: A persistent score is displayed on screen.
