## Features

* **Classic Pac-Man Gameplay**: Navigate the maze, eat all the pellets, and avoid the ghosts!
* **Unique Armenian Theme**:
    * The maze walls are built from **Tuf** (’ø’∏÷Ç÷Ü), a famous Armenian volcanic rock.
    * Pac-Man collects **Dram** (÷è), the currency of Armenia, instead of standard pellets.
* **Four Unique Ghosts**: Each ghost has its own canonical targeting AI implemented:
    * üî¥ **Blinky**: The chaser, who directly targets Pac-Man.
    * üå∏ **Pinky**: The ambusher, who targets a space in front of Pac-Man.
    * üíß **Inky**: The flanker, whose target is based on the positions of both Pac-Man and Blinky.
    * üçä **Clyde**: The unpredictable one, who chases Pac-Man when far away but retreats to his corner when close.
* **Animated Sprites**: Smooth, animated sprites for Pac-Man and all ghosts, with directional graphics.
* **UI Manager**: Clean game over and win screens with animated text that grows to fill the window.
* **Score Tracking**: A persistent score is displayed on screen.

## Prerequisites

Before you can build and run the project, you need to have a C++ compiler (`g++`) and the SFML library installed on your system.

### Installing SFML

* **On Debian/Ubuntu:**
    ```sh
    sudo apt-get install libsfml-dev
    ```
* **On macOS (using Homebrew):**
    ```sh
    brew install sfml
    ```
* **On Windows:**
    Download the appropriate SFML package from the [official website](https://www.sfml-dev.org/download.php) and follow their setup tutorials to configure it with your compiler (e.g., MinGW, Visual Studio).
